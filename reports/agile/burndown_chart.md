## Sprint Impediments & Resolutions

### Day 3-4: Dataset Download Issues
- **Issue**: Pascal VOC 2007 download servers slow
- **Impact**: 1-day delay
- **Resolution**: Parallel download implementation
- **Lesson**: Always have backup data sources

### Day 8: Model Integration Complexity
- **Issue**: YOLO model loading time affecting API response
- **Impact**: Performance concerns
- **Resolution**: Model caching at startup
- **Lesson**: Consider performance early in design

### Day 11: Frontend-Backend Integration
- **Issue**: CORS and file upload configuration
- **Impact**: Half-day debugging
- **Resolution**: Proper middleware configuration
- **Lesson**: Early integration testing prevents late issues
