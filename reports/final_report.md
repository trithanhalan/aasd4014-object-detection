## 1. Background & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Problem Definition
Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within images. This project addresses the specific challenge of detecting two important classes: persons and dogs. These classes were chosen because:

- **High Practical Value**: Person and dog detection has applications in surveillance, autonomous systems, and content moderation
- **Technical Challenge**: Both classes exhibit significant intra-class variation in appearance, pose, and scale
- **Dataset Availability**: Pascal VOC 2007 provides high-quality annotations for both classes

### 1.2 Project Objectives
1. **Primary Goal**: Develop a two-class object detection system with mAP@0.5 > 0.75
2. **Technical Goals**: 
   - Implement transfer learning with YOLOv5
   - Create end-to-end ML pipeline from data to deployment
   - Build intuitive web interface for real-time inference
3. **Academic Goals**: Demonstrate software engineering best practices and agile development

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Accurate detection of persons and dogs in diverse images
- Real-time inference (< 2 seconds per image)
- User-friendly web application
